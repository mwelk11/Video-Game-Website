This is a website about video games. I have made this website from scratch (minus the yo angular generator which generated my folder structure and initial files).

This website uses the following technologies:
 - AngularJS (Frontend)
 - NodeJS (Backend)
 - Bootstrap
 - HTML
 - mySQL

# video-games

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
